Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You'll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, we run three commands below:

npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app
yarn start

After the successfully running the commands, then our react app has been created and running, and we can now see a compiled successfully message.
